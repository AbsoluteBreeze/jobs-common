{"name":"Jobs Common","tagline":"Easily integrate job board APIs into your PHP application","body":"### About the project\r\nA few months ago I was playing around with several job board APIs when I realized that there was a huge lack of standardization in the way in which their APIs were written and accessed. Some of the problems I spotted right out of the gate were:\r\n\r\n- Every job board’s API demands different request parameters\r\n- Every API returns a different object type; some will only do XML, some JSON, and the names of fields can be just about anything\r\n- Some require API/Publisher keys\r\n- Some have libraries, some don’t; very few have good ones in PHP\r\n- Even if there are libraries, they still return non-standard results so you can’t compare one with another\r\n- Many of the PHP libraries are outdated, and don’t take advantage of stuff like Composer which makes it super easy to include in a project\r\n\r\nSo, I created an early version of this project and [blogged about it](http://www.karllhughes.com/2015/php-job-search-api-clients/) back in March, 2015. Steven Maguire saw the post and asked if I was interested in collaborating on a more mature version. Thanks to his well-crafted rewrite, we have what is here today.\r\n\r\nEven though the code has improved significantly, the goal has remained the same: to provide PHP developers with a simple and standardized way to access job board APIs.\r\n\r\n### Providers\r\nList of providers currently available:\r\n- [SimplyHired](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-simplyhired)\r\n- [Indeed](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-indeed)\r\n- [Careerbuilder](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-careerbuilder)\r\n- [Dice](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-dice)\r\n- [Government Jobs](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-govt)\r\n- [Careercast](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-careercast)\r\n\r\nWe have a long list of more providers we'd like to have someday.
