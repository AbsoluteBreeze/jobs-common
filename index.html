            What is Jobs Common?
        </h2>
        <p>A few months ago I was playing around with several job board APIs when I realized that there was a huge lack of standardization in the way in which their APIs were written and accessed. Some of the problems I spotted right out of the gate were:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Every job board’s API demands different request parameters</li>
        <li>Every API returns a different object type; some will only do XML, some JSON, and the names of fields can be just about anything</li>
        <li>Some require API/Publisher keys</li>
        <li>Some have libraries, some don’t; very few have good ones in PHP</li>
        <li>Even if there are libraries, they still return non-standard results so you can’t compare one with another</li>
        <li>Many of the PHP libraries are outdated, and don’t take advantage of stuff like Composer which makes it super easy to include in a project</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, I created an early version of this project and <a href="http://www.karllhughes.com/2015/php-job-search-api-clients/">blogged about it</a> back in March, 2015. Steven Maguire saw the post and asked if I was interested in collaborating on a more mature version. Thanks to his well-crafted rewrite, we have what is here today.</p>

        <p>Even though the code has improved significantly, the goal has remained the same: to provide PHP developers with a simple and standardized way to access job board APIs.</p>
